Farly - "Firewall Analysis and Rewrite LibrarY"

Farly is a firewall rule analysis library.

Farly translates a vendor specific firewall configuration
into an easily searchable vendor independent firewall model.

Using the Farly firewall model, Perl script based firewall 
management tools can be written to perform tasks such as 
firewall security audits, group or rule optimizations or
large scale firewall configuration changes.

Farly is object oriented, using a "key value coding" style.

Each line of firewall configuration is represented by an
Farly::Object object. Each property within the line of
configuration is represented by a key value pair.

The key describes what the property within the specific 
line of configuration is, such as "ID," or "SRC_IP."
 
The Farly::Object value objects are the basic types
found in a firewall configuration, such as IP addresses,
protocols, port numbers, string identifiers and references
to other configuration elements.

The entire firewall device model, made up of 
Farly::Object objects, is stored in an Farly::Object::List.
The Farly::Object::List class implements object search
functionality required for firewall rule analysis.

See "Farly" package SYNOPSIS for code which will dump a
container, illustrating the Farly model. (The file 'test.cfg'
in the /t directory may be used as an example firewall 
configuration.)

See the "demo" directory for Farly usage examples.

LIMITATIONS

- The Farly model is a subset of the firewall configuration relevant
  to interfaces, objects, groups, rules, and static routes.
- Interface IP addresses set with 'dhcp' are not supported.
- NAT configurations are not modeled.
- No IPv6 support
- The Cisco "ne" port operator is not currently supported.
- Cisco's "identity firewall" feature is not currently supported.

BUGS

The most likely bugs are around unrecognized variations within
a firewall configuration. Farly should throw an exception and display
the unrecognized line of configuration.

TODO

- More documentation
- More example scripts
- More devices supported
- IPv6 support
- IPv4 NAT support
